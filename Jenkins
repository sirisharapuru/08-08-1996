Jenkins - Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery/Deployment
< Continuous Integration = Continuous Build + Continuous test>
< Continuous Delivery = Manual way of Deployment to the Production>
< Continuous Deployment = Automatic way Deployment to the Production >
The Default Port number for Jenkins 8080
Jenkins is a JAVA BAsed Application ,So the Prerequisite for Jenkins is JAVA
Step1: Install JAVA
< yum install java >

To list the Installed packages 
< yum list installed >

To filter the required packages
< yum list installed | grep java >

To remove any package 
< yum remove <package name> >   or  << yum remove java* >>

## Run the following yum commands to install the package:
For OpenJDK 17
sudo yum install java-17-openjdk

For OpenJDK 11
sudo yum install java-11-openjdk

For OpenJDK 8
sudo yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk

## SCRIPT: ##
vim jenkins.sh

#STEP-1: INSTALLING GIT JAVA-1.8.0 MAVEN
yum install git java-1.8.0-openjdk maven -y

#STEP-2: GETTING THE REPO (jenkins.io --> download -- > redhat)
sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.repo
sudo rpm --import https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key

#STEP-3: DOWNLOAD JAVA11 AND JENKINS
amazon-linux-extras install java-openjdk11 -y
yum install jenkins -y
update-alternatives --config java

#STEP-4: RESTARTING JENKINS (when we download service it will on stopped state)
systemctl start jenkins.service
systemctl status jenkins.service

sh jenkins.sh


1. USER DEFINED PARAMETERS: this parameters can be given by user only.

a. Choice parameter: used when we have multiple options to generate a build but need to use only on specific one.
